# HR Analytics ‚Äî Predict Employee Attrition

## üîç Objective

Use data analytics and machine learning to:

- Understand key factors behind employee resignations
- Predict future attrition using classification models
- Explain model predictions using SHAP analysis
- Suggest actionable steps to reduce attrition

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data analysis, model building  
  Libraries used: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `shap`, `imblearn`
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard visualizing attrition insights
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**: For Python scripting and model development

---

## üìä Process Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Attrition by department, gender, education, and job role
- Salary bands, performance ratings, and promotion frequency
- Work-life balance, job satisfaction, and overtime trends

### 2. Model Building
- Built classification models: **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Evaluated models using F1-score, recall, and accuracy

### 3. Explainability with SHAP
- Visualized feature importance (beeswarm, force plots, summary)
- Identified key drivers of attrition
